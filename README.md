# Spatial_Systems-Hand_Toss_Demo
You can find my video demo [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw2eZcFNOY0) Please watch it or download the repo to see the app that I made. Overall, I used the Oculus Rift S along with Unity to make the application. A lot of my time went into making the correct connections between the movement scripts for a single grabbable object and the box select function. There were a lot of debugging for variables and the calculation time delays which led me to take 4 hours making the product and video rather than just 3. :( However, I had fun doing it. With more time, I believe I could have polished the app up even more as there is still a little bit of latency when you first pick up a group of objects along with the gliding distance sometimes being a bit too far. I hope you like the application I made. I greatly appreciate your time and consideration.
